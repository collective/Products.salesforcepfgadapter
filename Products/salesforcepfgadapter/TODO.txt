TODO.txt

- guard against SOQL injection
- figure out the correct session key

1.5+ - Future ideas

- write test for preset value map
- finish implementing create/upsert/update options
 * upsert, prepopulated:
  - query on form load, preserve that id and do an update to it on submit
  - if nothing found, just use defaults
 * upsert, not prepopulated: 
  - do an upsert API call on submit
  - make sure it's sane if there are multiple matches
 * update, prepopulated:
  - query on form load, preserve that id and do an update to it on submit
  - raise error if nothing found on form load
 * update, not prepopulated
  - query to find id of existing object that matches the key expression
  - raise error if nothing found or more than one found

- add a separate data grid for mapping additional hardcoded values (to avoid the need for using "server side fields")
- change default sObjectType to Lead
- make sure e-mail default expr doesn't get clobbered when turning off prepopulation setting

- An error should be thrown if Salesforce PFG Adapter product is installed and no Salesforce Base Connector
  object has been added to the site.
- fix i18n support for DataGridField column names, and implement the translation
- Take our type out of the types menu in Plone 3.0 (Awaiting fix to: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7370)
- Handle here or at other levels in the stack: 
   SoapFaultError: 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION' 'UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION: 
   Server unavailable due to scheduled maintenance'
- switch setDependencyMap and setFieldMap to an event driven system
